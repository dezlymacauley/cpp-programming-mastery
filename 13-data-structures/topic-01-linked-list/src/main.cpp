    ABOUT: Linked List

    Unlike a `vector`, you can't target each element in a Linked List 
    by using an index. This is because the elements are not arranged 
    continuously in memory.

    It's a list made of nodes.
    1. A Linked List, is a list of nodes
    2. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node on the list.
    3. The last node contains a value and a nullptr to indicate 
    that it is the end of the list.
